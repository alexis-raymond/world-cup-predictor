# World Cup Predictor

## Context
In November 2022, everyone, including myself, could only talk about one topic: the FIFA World Cup. At the same time, I was a consultant learning data science and machine learning. I always learned more effectively through projects and was looking for one that could result in real-life value. That is why I took on this objective to **predict the winner of the competition using historical football data**.

Starting this project on December 6th, I knew I wouldn't be done before the *actual* winner was determined. However, I would still benefit greatly from the learnings - and who knows, maybe my modelling will be useful outside of the World Cup. In fact, I came up with a very ambitious three-phase plan for this project:
1. Predict the winner of the 2022 FIFA World Cup using data exclusively from before the competition started
2. Generalize the model to predict the outcome of any football game in a major European League
3. Integrate gambling odds in the model to optimize sports betting

This plan is very ambitious and I doubt I'll get to step 2 (nevermind step 3), but I think it's important to have a North Star. A reason behind taking on any new project. This plan is mine and I hope to learn a great deal along the way.
